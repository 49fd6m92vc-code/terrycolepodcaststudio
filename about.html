      <p>
        The <strong>Terry Cole Podcast Studio</strong> is part of the Terry Cole
        Broadcast &amp; Recording Studio, created to preserve, share, and continue
        a legacy rooted in radio, storytelling, and community service.
      </p>

      <p>
        Named in honor of broadcaster Terry Cole, the studio serves as both an
        archival space and a living production environment — connecting past
        broadcasts with new voices and contemporary audio projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based in Ohio, the studio is dedicated to preserving and sharing the
        legacy of broadcaster Terry Cole through podcasts, recorded audio
        projects, and archival storytelling.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        This studio exists to ensure meaningful voices, local history, and

        the past while supporting new recorded works.
      </div>

      <p>
        In addition to archival work, the studio supports podcasts and recorded
        projects from community members, institutions, and collaborators who
        share a commitment to thoughtful, purpose-driven audio.
